    "\n",
    "- **Total Schools and Students:** There are a total of 15 schools in the dataset, with a combined student population of 39,170.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passing Rates:** Approximately 86.08% of students passed math, while 84.43% passed reading. An impressive 72.81% of students passed both math and reading, indicating a strong overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency in Top Schools:** The top-performing schools exhibit a consistent level of excellence, with minimal variations in their overall passing percentages. This suggests that these schools have effective strategies in place to maintain high academic standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Impact of School Type:** Independent schools outperform government schools in terms of average scores and overall passing rates. This highlights the potential benefits of different governance models and the need for targeted improvements in government-funded education."
